## SecurityCAT

SecurityCAT (Compliance Automation Tool) is an extension for SecurityRAT meant for automatic testing of requirements. 
Given that the implementation depends on the particular used requirements, everybody should implement his own respective version of SecurityCAT.
SecurityRAT just defines an API it can speak to and which can be used for starting a scan, fetching the results and stopping a scan. 

SecurityCAT is meant to be implemented via [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS), this means that SecurityRAT doesn't talk to SecurityCAT directly, but the integration is done via browser. This implicates that CORS Headers need to be delivered by SecurityCAT, these are described below. 

## API specification

### Create a test 

Request:

```
POST /scanapi/tests

{
    requirements : ["req1_shortName", "req2_shortName", ....],
    testProperties : {
        sonarKey : sonarqube_key,
        scmUrl : scm_url,
        appUrl : appUrl
    }
}
```

* ```requirements``` contains the list of requirement shortnames, which are supposed to be tested
* ```testProperties```:
  * ```sonarKey``` indicates sonarqube key of the artifact in sonarqube
  * ```scmUrl``` indicates the URL of the source code repository where the code can be checked out
  * ```appUrl``` indicates the URL of the application which can be used for black box tests

Reponse 202/Accepted containing the URL for fetching the result in the ```Location``` header is expected. 

### Fetch test results

Request:

```
GET /scanapi/tests/{test_id}
```

Response contains an array of requirements being tested together with the current status of the test.

```curl
200/OK
 
[{
    requirement: req_shortName
    testResults: [{
        status: ERROR/IN_PROGRESS/PASSED/FAILED
        confidenceLevel: 90
        message: String
        tool: tool_name
    }]
}]

Everything not 200 (e.g. 401 for authenticated scans and wrong username or password)
 
[{
    requirement: null
    testResults: [{
        status: ERROR
        confidenceLevel: null
        message: String
        tool: tool_name
    }]
}]
```

* ```status``` describes the state of the test:
  * ```ERROR```: Test could not be completed
  * ```IN_PROGRESS```: Test is being executed
  * ```PASSED```: Test was completed and the requirement is fulfilled.
  * ```FAILED```: Test was completed and the requirement is not fulfilled.
* ```confidenceLevel``` indicates the value in percent about reliability of the test
* ```message``` contains detailed description of the test, markdown is supported
* ```tool``` indicates the name of tool / microservice which actually performed the test

### Stop the test

Request:

```
DELETE /scanapi/tests/{test_id}
```

Response 200 is expected.

## CORS Headers

The following CORS Headers need to be delivered by SecurityCAT if you want the CORS integration with SecurityRAT to work:

```apacheconf
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: {SecurityRAT_URL}
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS,DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type, x-securitycat-csrf
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location
Vary: Origin      
```
